# Server Software
## Work in progress -MrRazamataz

The core of a Minecraft server is the software/ it runs on. This is the software that the server is running. Depending on which you use your 
performance, server abilities, and support may change.

This list I am compiling here covers all of the different Minecraft Bedrock Server Softwares I have encountered and links to them too.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Not Full Vanilla Software:
Server software that is not full vanilla (could be used for minigames or other gamemodes). Just because its not full vanilla doesnt mean its not a valid option for a SMP server.

**If next to the server software name, there are these double asterisks, it means the software could be at risk of very slow updates or lack of support.
  
[PocketMine](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) : PocketmineMP (PMMP) is server software for bedrock edition written in PHP. Its very lacking in vanilla features without any plugins installed, but it does perform well on very litte hardware. Plugins can be found [here](https://poggit.pmmp.io/plugins). 

[Nukkit](https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Nukkit) : Nukkit (Sometimes called CloudBurst Nukkit/Nukkit 1.0*) is written in Java and has more vanilla features than pocketmine but nothing above Java Edition 1.12 features. The plugins for it can be found [here](https://cloudburstmc.org/resources/).

[PowerNukkit](https://github.com/PowerNukkit/PowerNukkit) : PowerNukkit is a fork of Nukkit, that adds more features ontop of Nukkit 1.0*.
